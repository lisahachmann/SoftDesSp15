README
For this toolbox script to work, you need to have pygame installed. 
To install pygame, use this line in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install python-pygame

Note: 
To change into lava mode, press lowercase "L" (so specifically, 'l') 
To change into swamp mode, press lowercase "S" (specifically, 's')

The printed numbers in the boxes are the F code numbers, which is the sum of the distance to the end (using Manhattan city block estimation technique) and how many tiles away from the player (Paul) you have walked/gone.
