README:
In order to run philosophywikipedia.py, you need to install both Pattern and BeautifulSoup for Python. 
this is best done with the lines:
(sudo) pip install pattern
and 
(sudo) pip install beautifulsoup4

In order to run graphingwikipedia.py, you need to install Plotly, a new version of matplotlib. This is best done with the line:
(sudo) pip install plotly

Graphingwikipedia.py uploads straight to lisa.joelle.hachmann's account and should open a tab in your existing or default broswer. 
In order to change the plot's location, you need to:
1) Have a plotly account (go online)
2) Replace 'lisa.joelle.hachmann' with your username
3) Replace the key that follows it with your specific key (found under settings of your account)
The two files are linked in that the results of multiple words in philosophywikipedia can be put in the graphingwikipedia's x and y (words as X, values as Y) in order to create the bar graph. 
Happy Philosophy Game!
